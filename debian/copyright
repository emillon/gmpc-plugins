All the plugins are gpl and will stay gpl version 2 or higher.

gmpc-avahi is originally written by Jim Ramsey and later modified by me.
gmpc-lyrics is originally written by Maxime Petazzoni and modified by me.
gmpc-alarm is written by Gavin Gilmour and is now maintained by me.
gmpc-lirc is written by Igor Stirbu and is now maintained by me.


The rest of the plugins:
gmpc-mdcover,
gmpc-coveramazon,
gmpc-lyricwiki,
gmpc-discogs,
gmpc-jamendo,
gmpc-magnatune,
gmpc-last.fm,

, gmpc and libmpd are written by me, Martijn Koedam, under the gpl license.
Gmpc-awn, gmpc-wikipedia and gmpc-fullscreeninfo are not maintained by me
anymore.

gmpc contains (l)gpl code taken from libbacon, libegg and gtk.
gmpc-mserver used to contain a copy of libmicrohttp, but that has been
removed, gmpc-magnatune used to include a copy of axl xml library, but
that also has been removed.

If you need a list off all contributors let me know. (but will take some
time.)

Hope this is sufficient and hopefully without stupid errors.
