A bunch of random thoughts, TODOs including features and general fixes.

Legend:
	[ ] - incomplete
	[x] - complete
	[X] - major complete
	[-] - removed
	[!] - in progress/half done
	[?] - completed but may break
	[_] - deferred, unneeded? 

TODO:
	[ ] - update statusbar to show timer if playlist is focused
	[x] - allow spinners to wrap time (seconds affects minutes affects hours) (gtk+ 2.10.x+ only)
	[x] - fix timer not checking if preference page active before updating label
	[ ] - fix strange %02d behavior with spinner fields
	[_] - fix crude variable (prefs_active) for representing if prefs page is visible 
		- (for updates to countdown label)

Future:
	[ ] - custom user actions
	[ ] - better way to schedule time in general?
		- current uses timeout and checks every second.. :/
